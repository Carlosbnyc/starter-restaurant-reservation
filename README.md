	•	PostgreSQL
	•	Bootstrap
	•	HTML5
	•	CSS
	•	Git

Key Learnings

	•	Utilizing Git for version control is essential for maintaining organization and enabling the implementation of features independently.
	•	Staying focused while developing a full-stack application can be challenging; using a Kanban board can significantly contribute to successful project management.
	•	When coding, it’s best not to overcomplicate things initially; prioritize writing functional code first, and then optimize it as needed.

Conclusion

This project marked my first experience building a full-stack application with minimal initial code. I had the freedom to design the interface according to my vision, with a focus on functionality rather than aesthetics in the testing process. The sense of accomplishment after successfully implementing each feature and witnessing the entire project come together deepened my appreciation for software development and inspired me to continue learning and advancing my skills.
